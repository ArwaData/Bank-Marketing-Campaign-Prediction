# Bank-Marketing-Campaign-Prediction

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y). Â 

The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client is required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed which means that the binary classification productive modules are the most suitable modules for this problem. 

We choose the logistic regression and SVM model to train the data with and predict the result as two classes that will let us know which columns (variables) has the most effect on whether the client will subscribe a term deposit after a marketing campaigns of banking institution.
